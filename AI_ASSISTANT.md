## Implementation Details

### Files Created

1. **`lib/ai-knowledge-base.ts`**
   - Mock AI response system
   - Pattern matching for questions
   - Context-aware suggestions
   - ~20+ pre-written intelligent responses

2. **`components/ai-assistant.tsx`**
   - Main chat component
   - Floating button
   - Message handling

### Integration

Added to `app/dashboard/layout.tsx`:

### Response System

The AI uses pattern matching to detect keywords in questions:

```typescript
export function getAIResponse(question: string, context: string): AIResponse {
  const q = question.toLowerCase()

  if (q.includes("outstanding") || q.includes("‚Çπ27.5")) {
    return { answer: "...", suggestions: [...] }
  }

  // ... more patterns
}
```

### Context Detection

Suggestions change based on current page:

```typescript
export function getContextualQuestions(pathname: string): string[] {
  if (pathname.includes("/dashboard/analytics")) {
    return ["Why is revenue ‚Çπ45.2L?", ...]
  }
  // ... more contexts
}
```

## Pre-Written Responses

The system has intelligent responses for:

  return {
    answer: `Your detailed explanation here...

    ‚Ä¢ Bullet point 1
    ‚Ä¢ Bullet point 2

    Recommendations:
    1. Action item 1
    2. Action item 2`,
    suggestions: [
      "Follow-up question 1?",
      "Follow-up question 2?",
    ],
  }
}
```

### Changing Appearance

Edit `components/ai-assistant.tsx`:

### Adding Page-Specific Questions

Edit `getContextualQuestions()` in `lib/ai-knowledge-base.ts`:

  return [
    "Question 1?",
    "Question 2?",
    "Question 3?",
  ]
